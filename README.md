The Timetable Generator is an automated scheduling tool designed to help institutions or organizations schedule classes seamlessly. It allows users to input details like class name, teacher, date, and time, and the generator automatically creates a schedule for the specified day without the need for manual intervention.

The tool eliminates human error and optimizes scheduling by distributing tasks evenly across the available slots.
